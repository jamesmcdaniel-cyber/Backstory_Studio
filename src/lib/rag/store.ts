 * facts hang off accounts. This interface stores those as embedded nodes +
 * typed edges and supports the two graph-RAG operations: vector `search`
 * (find semantically relevant nodes) and `expand` (walk edges to gather the
 * connected neighborhood). Every operation is organization-scoped.
 *
 * Implementations: `MemoryGraphStore` (tests, local dev, and a working default
 * when no external store is configured) and `Neo4jGraphStore` (production).
