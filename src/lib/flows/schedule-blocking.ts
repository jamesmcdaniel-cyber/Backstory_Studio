 * concurrent scheduled executions. Pure companion to the reaper in ./reap:
 * `running` runs are reaped after 30 min, so they always block here; `waiting`
 * runs are a legitimate pause (approval / ask-user) the reaper must not touch
 * — but an unanswered one must not wedge the schedule forever, so after 24h it
 * stops blocking while the run itself stays answerable.
